```

## Insert Row / Record

```sql
INSERT INTO users (
    first_name, last_name, email, password, location, dept, is_admin, register_date
    ) values ('Brad', 'Traversy', 'brad@gmail.com', '123456','Massachusetts', 'development', 1, now());
```

## Insert Multiple Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, email, password, location, dept, is_admin, register_date)
values('Fred', 'Smith', 'fred@gmail.com', '123456', 'New York', 'design', 0, now()),
('Sara', 'Watson', 'sara@gmail.com', '123456', 'New York', 'design', 0, now()),
('Will', 'Jackson', 'will@yahoo.com', '123456', 'Rhode Island', 'development', 1, now()),
('Paula', 'Johnson', 'paula@yahoo.com', '123456', 'Massachusetts', 'sales', 0, now()),
('Tom', 'Spears', 'tom@yahoo.com', '123456', 'Massachusetts', 'sales', 0, now());
```

## Select

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users;
```

## Where Clause

> conditions

```bash
field1 = value1
field1 <= value1
field1 >= value1
field1 < value1
field1 > value1
field1 <> value1
field1 LIKE 'value _ %'
field1 IS NULL
field1 IS NOT NULL
field1 IS IN (value1, value2)
field1 IS NOT IN (value1, value2)
condition1 AND condition2
condition1 OR condition2
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE location='Massachusetts';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE location='Massachusetts' AND dept='sales';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_admin = 1;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_admin > 0;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE location IN ('Rhode Island', 'Massachusetts');
```

## Like (Searching)

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mysql-regular-expressions-regexp/

```sql

SELECT * FROM users WHERE dept LIKE 'd%';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE dept LIKE 'dev%';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE dept LIKE '%t';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE dept LIKE '%e%';
```

## Not Like

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE dept NOT LIKE 'd%';
```

## IN

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE dept IN ('design', 'sales');
```

## Delete Row

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 6;
```

## Update Row

```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'freddy@gmail.com' WHERE id = 2;
```

## Order By (Sort)

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY last_name ASC;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY last_name DESC;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY first_name asc, last_name DESC;
```

## Limit results

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY first_name asc, last_name DESC LIMIT 20;

-- oFFSEt
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY first_name asc, last_name DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 5;

-- or
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY first_name asc, last_name DESC LIMIT 5, 20;

```

## Select Distinct Rows

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT location FROM users;
SELECT DISTINCT location,first_name FROM users;
```

> either fields are distinct then row will be selected

## Concatenate Columns

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS 'Name', dept FROM users;

```

## Between (Select Range)

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 25;
```

## Create & Remove Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX LIndex On users(location);
DROP INDEX LIndex ON users;
```

## New Table With Foreign Key (Posts)

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts(
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
   user_id INT,
   title VARCHAR(100),
   body TEXT,
   publish_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   PRIMARY KEY(id),
   FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## Add Data to Posts Table

```sql
INSERT INTO posts(user_id, title, body) VALUES (1, 'Post One', 'This is post one'),(3, 'Post Two', 'This is post two'),(1, 'Post Three', 'This is post three'),(2, 'Post Four', 'This is post four'),(5, 'Post Five', 'This is post five'),(4, 'Post Six', 'This is post six'),(2, 'Post Seven', 'This is post seven'),(1, 'Post Eight', 'This is post eight'),(3, 'Post Nine', 'This is post none'),(4, 'Post Ten', 'This is post ten');
```

## INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT
  users.first_name,
  users.last_name,
  posts.title,
  posts.publish_date
FROM users
INNER JOIN posts
ON users.id = posts.user_id
ORDER BY posts.title;
```

## New Table With 2 Foriegn Keys

```sql
CREATE TABLE comments(
	id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    post_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    body TEXT,
    publish_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) references users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(post_id) references posts(id)
);
```

## Add Data to Comments Table

```sql
INSERT INTO comments(post_id, user_id, body) VALUES (1, 3, 'This is comment one'),(2, 1, 'This is comment two'),(5, 3, 'This is comment three'),(2, 4, 'This is comment four'),(1, 2, 'This is comment five'),(3, 1, 'This is comment six'),(3, 2, 'This is comment six'),(5, 4, 'This is comment seven'),(2, 3, 'This is comment seven');
```

## Left Join

```sql
SELECT
comments.body,
posts.title
FROM comments
LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.id = comments.post_id
ORDER BY posts.title;

```

## Join Multiple Tables

```sql
SELECT
comments.body,
posts.title,
users.first_name,
users.last_name
FROM comments
INNER JOIN posts on posts.id = comments.post_id
INNER JOIN users on users.id = comments.user_id
ORDER BY posts.title;

```

## Aggregate Functions

```sql
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(distinct first_name) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(location), location FROM users group by location;
SELECT MAX(age) FROM users;
SELECT MIN(age) FROM users;
SELECT avg(id) FROM users;
SELECT SUM(age) FROM users;
SELECT UPPER(first_name), LOWER(last_name) FROM users;
SELECT SUBSTRING(first_name, 1, 4) FROM users;
```

## Group By

```sql
SELECT age, COUNT(age) FROM users GROUP BY age;
SELECT age, COUNT(age) FROM users WHERE age > 20 GROUP BY age;
SELECT age, COUNT(age) FROM users GROUP BY age HAVING count(age) >=2;

```

## If Statements

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  IF(age>=21, 'Old Enough', 'Too Young') AS Age_Status
FROM users;

-- IFNULL
SELECT
  id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  IFNULL(age, 'No Age') AS Age
FROM users;


```
